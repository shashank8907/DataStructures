// Set
/** 
 set DS is like an array but no dup items and the values are in no perticular order
 
 ES6 has a built in set object -- but doesn'rcontain all the methods that are common to sets so you may want to impliment the part of the set itself depending on what you are using it for


 methods that are part of ES6: values, add, delete , size(property)
 not in ES6 sets: union(combine sets and remove duplicates),
